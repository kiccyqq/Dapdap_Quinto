                <h5>Kizzahya Mesiah <span>Quinto</span></h5>
                <p>I am a second year student of BSIT in Bicol University under College of Science. I am currently
                    20 years old. I don't have that much hobbies relating to computer aside from video editing,
                    photoshop, and e-games.Honestly, IT didn't crossed my mind even before I finished SHS but 
                    since it was the only course in-line with our family's financial status at the time, I had 
                    no choice but to take it. Hopefully I'll be able to graduate under this course. Though I 
                    want to tell you more about myself, this page is only meant to give information about
